UNIFIED EVENT ANALYTICS ENGINE - ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT

OVERVIEW
The Unified Event Analytics Engine is a robust system designed to collect, process, and analyze event data from various applications. The architecture follows modern best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

1. BACKEND FRAMEWORK
- Express.js: Used as the primary Node.js framework to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware implementation.
- Decision rationale: Express provides a lightweight, flexible foundation that's ideal for building RESTful APIs while maintaining high performance.

2. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
- Multiple auth methods:
  * OAuth 2.0 with Google (via Passport.js)
  * API key-based authentication for service-to-service communication
- Session management: Express-session for maintaining user sessions
- Decision rationale: This dual approach provides secure user authentication for dashboard access while enabling programmatic API access for data collection.

3. API DESIGN
- RESTful API principles: Clear resource naming, appropriate HTTP methods
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation: Auto-generated API documentation
- Decision rationale: Well-documented APIs improve developer experience and make integration easier.

4. SECURITY MEASURES
- Middleware approach:
  * ValidateApiKey: Validates API keys for programmatic access
  * ValidateUser: Ensures users have proper permissions
  * RateLimiter: Prevents abuse through request limiting
- Input validation: Comprehensive validation using express-validator
- Decision rationale: Defense-in-depth approach to protect against common attack vectors.

5. DATA ARCHITECTURE
- Model layer: Separation of data access logic (EventModel, KeysModel)
- Decision rationale: Clear separation of concerns between data access and business logic.

6. MIDDLEWARE ORGANIZATION
- Feature-specific middleware files:
  * collect-validations.js
  * event-summary-validations.js
  * auth.js
  * rate-limiter.js
- Decision rationale: Modular approach that keeps code organized and maintainable.

7. ERROR HANDLING & VALIDATION
- Express-validator: Structured validation for all inputs
- Consistent error responses: Standardized error format
- Decision rationale: Robust validation prevents data quality issues and improves security.

8. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
- Stateless API design: Enables horizontal scaling
- Rate limiting: Protects against traffic spikes
- Decision rationale: Prepares the system for growth without architectural changes.

9. ENDPOINTS ORGANIZATION
- Hierarchical routing: Main router delegates to feature-specific routes
- Decision rationale: Makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.

10. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
- Environment variables: Using dotenv for configuration
- Decision rationale: Keeps sensitive information out of the codebase and enables environment-specific configuration.

APPLICATION FLOW
1. Client applications generate events
2. Events are sent to the /analytics/collect endpoint with API key authentication
3. Validation middleware ensures data quality
4. Events are stored in the database via the EventModel
5. Authenticated users can query analytics data via dashboard endpoints
   - /analytics/event-summary provides aggregated event data
   - /analytics/user-stats provides user-specific analytics

FUTURE ARCHITECTURE CONSIDERATIONS
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed analytics
- Consider message queues for handling high traffic loads
- Add support for custom event definitions
- For very high write systems we can implement master slave architecture for the database
